# liiteriback

Backend for the two animation for testing the liiteri's tablet.

Node + mongoose. I made a production build from the frontend and used express to view it. Frontend: https://github.com/pidrmasiin/liiteriDnD

To use locally you need nodeJs and npm. https://nodejs.org/en/ 

# To run locally: 

Clone the gitrepo and install modules with "npm install" command. 

Then you have to make a production build from the frontend with "npm run build" command. Copy the build folder from the frontend and paste it to the backend.

Then start the backend with "npm start" command. It should works. 

You can add your own mogoose database in ".env" -file. It seems I forgot to gitignore it :D
